> While working through my [Udemy Course](demy.com/course/understand-javascript/), I thought it would be a great idea to build a mini project to practice the patterns I was learning.


### What the Web App does:

Dynamically generates a typography poster based on the users information. 

##### It asks 8 basic questions: 
First Name, Last Name, Hobby 1, Hobby 2, Job Title, Pet Name, Color and Favorite Number 

Once the information is submitted you receive a styled responsive typography poster with you information.

### Purpose of the Web App:

To practice using Constructor Functions and CSS Grids, *UNTIL* I starting writing the constructor functions and decided to refactor it. 

**Before the code looked something like this:**

```
  function Person() {

  this.firstName = inputFirstNme.value;
  this.lastName = inputLastNme.value;
  this.hobby1 = hobby1.value;
  this.hobby2 = hobby2.value;
  this.jobTitle = jobTitle.value;
  this.favColor = colorInput.value;
  this.favNumber = favNumber.value;
  this.petName = petName.value;
  this.firstInitial = this.firstName[0];
  this.secondInitial = this.lastName[0];


  this.applyStyles = function(element, text) {
    var elementToPage = element;
    elementToPage.innerText = this[text];
    return elementToPage;
  }

}
```

 I decided maybe this wasn’t the best place to use Constructor Functions and that I should probably practice using the Class pattern in my next project. 
So I stripped the code down a bit to a very simple solution. 

**And now the code looks something like this:**

```
function applyStyles(element, text, parentContainer) {
  var elementToPage = element;
  elementToPage.innerText = text;
  parentContainer.append(elementToPage);
}
```



### CSS Grid
Once the JS was settled (for now) it was time to put the responsive frame together using CSS Grids.
